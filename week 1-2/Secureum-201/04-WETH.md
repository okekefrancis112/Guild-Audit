## Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)

Ethereum as a distributed and decentralized blockchain has its native coin called ether which is used to pay for transaction fees as gas across the network. it is also used in strengthening the network via validations and governance. With the advent of the ERC20 standard and a trove of tokens built on it that are compatible and interoperable with each other, it becomes necessary to make ether ERC20 compatible which it isn't. This will help in facilitating swaps and dapps development and easy interaction with other ERC20 assets.

Since ERC20 tokens can only be traded with other erc20 tokens, a situation where one wants to trade ether for another token becomes difficult hence a solution needs to be invented to solve this compatibility problem.

Wrapped ether(WETH) was introduced as a solution to this, WETH is the Erc20 tradeable version of ETH.

With this development, the value of WETH is pegged to the value of ether as a 1:1 ratio similarly to how stable coins are wrapped to the value of the dollar on a 1:1 ratio. Taking this further, wrapped assets can also exist on other EVM Compatible blockchains like matic and avalanche so users can get to trade a wrapped version of eth on that blockchain to other assets native to that blockchain.

#### How to get WETH
basically to get a wrapped Ether (WETH) ether is sent into a smart contract and locked, then the equivalent (WETH) is then sent to the users account. the reverse is true when unwrapping, the weth is sent to a smart contract and unwrapped back to ether after which that weth is then burnt to balance the circulation and maintain the pegged value to ether

The main purpose  of WETH is to make Ether ERC20 complaint so that it can find numerous uses in things like liquidity pools and NFT trading. On the long run though, ethereum development road-map is geared towards making the network as a whole interoperable thereby eliminating the need for WETH. Exchanges like uniswap and platforms like opensea provides means of wrapping and also unwrapping ether.

So in the main time weth is very much useful for ether interoperability.
