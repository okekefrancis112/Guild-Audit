## Liquidity Pools

Liquidity in crypto and blockchain world is the ease in which a digital asset in this case cryptocurrency can be easily traded for another digital asset.
Liquidity pools are inherently powered by smart contracts with pool tokens bested i.e in this case, a developer or token creator  choosed to provide the initial liquidity for a pair, say cake/busd. This way, an investor that want to partake have to provide equal amount of the two token, stake them and thus providing more liquidity. in turn they tend to share the gas fees generated from the pool in the ratio of their stake.

By providing such high liquidity, users can easily sell and buy tokens without bothering much on orders to be fulfilled meaning they rapidly get to exhange their token for another.

Aside from profiting from gas fees or been rewarded sometimes in the exchange native token, liquidity providers and users can also take part in governance where they get to decide on issues such as gas fees and pool sizes.

### Challenges Faced
##### Impermanent Loss

This occurs when the price of one of the token pairs greatly fluctuates, which in turn affects the other pair in most cases a stable coin. A loss is invariably incurred that is deemed impermanent. it only becomes permanent when the user decides to unstake or remove his provided liquidity.

##### Slippage
pools with less liquidity tend to suffer high slippage and those with high liquidity tends to be more stable. Since slippage is the difference between the price one is expected to pay for a token and the price they actually paid for the token. A larger pool reduces this incident.

##### Rug Pulls
This occurs when developers of a project suddenly remove all liquidity from a pool, rendering the asset worthless and token unsellable incurring loss to investors.

##### Unsellable Tokens
Malicious developers can secretly make a token smart contract to be locked such that selling is only possible by the owners of administrators. Then after much funds have been raised either through social means or ICO (initial coin offerings), the developers run away with funds and leaving tokens purchased unsellable and worthless

##### Ways to avoid pool scams
Ensure the authenticity of developers through careful research and background checks
Ensure that liquidity is locked if possible
Ensure the token contract is audited
