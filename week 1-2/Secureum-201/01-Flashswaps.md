## FlashSwaps

Flashswaps commonly known as flashloans are a kind of uncollaterized lending offered by top defi platforms such as DyDx. By uncollaterized, it means no assets is dropped in exchange for the borrowed loan. In the traditional financial system, such an asset can be land or possibly gold that reflects the amount borrowed. This opens a lot of opportunities as virtually anybody can have access to a large sum of money in hope to make profit.

The catch here is that this loan must be repaid before the transaction ends(i.e before the ethereum blockchain updates the user's account balance). if they fail to repay, the transaction reverts.

unlike traditional swap that ensures the user have a token that they want to swap for another, flashswaps does no such check only that whatever is borrowed be paid simultaneously usually in seconds. To match this speed, it's common to see bots known as flashbots operating in this regard.

### Use Cases
##### Arbitraging

Arbitraging can be seen as taking advantage of price differences in two mediums i.e exchanges in other to make a profit for example, a user notices that the price of eth on exchange A is usd1200 and the price on exchange B is usd1250. This user can get eth on exchange A and sells higher on exchange B thereby profitting from the difference. Flashloans can also be used for this process even allowing the user to commit nothing from their side (i.e monetary input), all they need do is take a loan from one exchange and quickly sell on another.

### Downsides (Hackers Exploit)

Some have argued that when a user benefits from a system that gives him right to his action, it shouldn't be seen as a hack, but an exploit since they merely outsmarted such a system. this goes for most attacks on flashloans as malicious actors use such a system to manipulate the market thereby causing huge price swings in different exchanges and then using flashloan opportunities to make money out of it. unfortunately ruining the price of the unfortunate victim assets(token). Such was the case of pancake swap bunny whose token fell drastically by about 95% when a flashloan of BNB was used to manipulate, steal and dump a large amount of bunny token on the market causing a downward spiral.

### Way forward

One way to mitigate the effect of a flashloan is using decentralized network of oracles that watch all account for volume and liquidity differences accross multiple exchanges and different transactions. by so doing, large price swings if any are monitored and immediately balanced or prevented.
