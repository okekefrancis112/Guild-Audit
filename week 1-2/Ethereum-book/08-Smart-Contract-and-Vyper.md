This is synonymous to the smart contract and solidity as described and explained in chapter 07 but in this case implemented in vyper, a language written in python for writing smart contracts.

Due to the popularity of solidity, it is now common to see contracts written in them than with vyper, so for this review focus is given mostly to solidity.
