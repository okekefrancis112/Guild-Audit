## Consensus

Consensus refers to the mechanism where network participants use to arrive at the state of the blockchain, consensus algorithms are the mechanism used to reconcile security and decentralization

#### Proof of Work

In the proof of work method of consensus, miners use specialized rigs or system to try and solve a difficult computation in other to have the right to add the next block to the blockchain, usually this involves a huge amount of electricity cost and also high cost of buying specialized rigs to meet up the performance needed to compute such difficulty.

Bitcoin first initiated the proof of work concept and ethereum's own version uses what is called Ethash. This is also used for securing the blockchain and decentralizing control

#### Proof of Stake

In the proof of stake method of consensus, participants also known as validators purchase the native token of the blockchain and stake it by sending a special type of transaction that locks up their ether into a deposit. this validators then take turns proposing and voting on the next valid block with the weight of the vote dependent on the validators deposit. They are incentivized to act properly or lose a portion of their stake if found to be malicious. They also earn rewards when a block is accepted by the majority in the network.
