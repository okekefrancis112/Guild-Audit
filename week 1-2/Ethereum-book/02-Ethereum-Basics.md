## Ethereum Basics

Ethereum currency unit is called ether and has a division of smaller units with the least been "wei" where 1 ether is equivalent to 1 quantillion wei (1 * 10^18). This is popularly written as 
1 ether = 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 wei. Other denominations exist such as Gwei, Babbage, Szabo and finney.

For performing transactions on the ethereum blockchain, a wallet is needed. This stores the user private keys and are used to sign transactions.

choosing a suitable wallet and maintaining good security practice is paramount to keep funds safe, for a robust and trusted wallet, Metamask is the best choice for pc and web interface while users of mobile can securely use trustwallet.

As a personal bank, wallets are native to the particular user hence its security and safe keeping is to be handled by the user as loss of funds and passwords won't be recoverable unless the user backed up their private key or seed phrases. A couple of safety tips inclued:


* Always backup your private key or seed phrases preferrably in paper and not in digital format
* The best form of wallet is a cold wallet. Examples such as flash drives from safepal, ledger and trezor are good choices
* Never share your private key with anyone
* When required to transfer a large amount to an address unfamiliar to you, first transfer a small amount to ensure it goes through
* Ensure the authenticity of applications before connecting your wallet, approving or signing transactions

Also when making transactions on the blockchain, explorers such as etherscan can be used to check information about the transaction to know status; whether pending or successful and also further informations can be gotten from explorers such as block heights, transaction details, value etc.

Addresses in ethereum can be either of an EOA (Externally Owned Account)  or contract address. EOA are such addresses you get when an account is created from a client like metamask while contract accounts is the address of a deployed smart contract.

Various tools exists for writing, testing and deploying smart contracts such as vscode, hardhat, foundry, truffle, ethersjs etc. but for beginners looking to experiment with solidity in writing contracts, an online ide called remix is very suitable. with this, contracts can be easily compiled and deployed, error checks are immediately shown plus it provides addresses that can be used for testing purposes and connect very well with metamask
